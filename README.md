## About me
<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Interested in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science, Parallel/Distributed computing and Software Development.

I have worked previously as a Software Developer in Irvine, California, USA. Before this, I got my Doctoral degree in Structural engineering from University of California San Diego, in the field of Computational Mechanics (Numerical Simulation/Scientific computing).

Below are examples of a few personal projects, some of them are from my Doctoral thesis and some are from current class projects. They include application problems or surveys for machine learning, parallel computing, image segmentation, numerical analysis and reduced order modeling using principal component analysis.
