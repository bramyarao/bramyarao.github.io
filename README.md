## About
<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Interested in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science, Parallel/Distributed computing and Software Development.

I have worked previously as a Software Developer in Irvine, California, USA. Before this, I got my Doctoral degree in Structural engineering from University of California San Diego, in the field of Computational Mechanics (Numerical Simulation/Scientific computing).

Below are examples of a few personal projects, some of them are from my Doctoral thesis and some are from current class projects. They include standard application problems for machine learning, parallel computing, image segmentation, numerical analysis and reduced order modeling using principal component analysis.

## Coding Projects
<div style="text-align: justify">
  
  * Solving the **2D Poisson problem** numerically. Coded in MATLAB. <a href="https://bramyarao.github.io/2D-POISSON-MATLAB/">Link to the repository</a>.
  
  * Solving the **2D Poisson problem** numerically (same problem as done in MATLAB). Now coded in Python3. <a href="https://bramyarao.github.io/2D-POISSON-PYTHON/">Link to the repository</a>. Coming soon...
  
  * **Horse Racing prediction using Machine Learning**. Coded in parallel using C language with MPI. Scaling up Stochastic Gradient Descent. Coming soon...
  
  * **Reduced order modeling using Principal Component Analysis, for wave equation**. Solved numerically using meshfree method. Coming soon...
  
  * **Image segmentation** (RGB image) using Level Set based method. Coming soon...
