## About
Currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at University of British Columbia, Vancouver.  
Interested in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science, Parallel/Distributed computing and Software Development.  
I have worked previously as a Software Developer in Irvine, California, USA. Before this, I got my Doctoral degree in Structural engineering, in the field of Computational Mechanics (Numerical Simulation/Scientific computing).  
Below are a few examples/self-made projects. They include simple or standard application problems for machine learning, parallel computing, image segmentation, numerical analysis and reduced order modeling using principal component analysis.
